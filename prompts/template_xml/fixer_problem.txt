</code>

The code has the following build issues:
<error>
{ERROR_MESSAGES}
</error>

Fix code:
1. Consider the possible solution for the issues listed above.
2. Apply the solutions to the original code.
Check and make sure the fuzz harness calls <code>{FUNCTION_NAME}</code>.
The function was declared with the following signature in the source code:
<code>
